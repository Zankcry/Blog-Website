    <h2 class="sub-heading">Introduction</h2>
    <p class="post-text">The increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in our daily lives through various applications, services, and products highlights the significance of trust and distrust in AI from a user perspective. AI-driven systems have significantly merged into various aspects of our lives, serving as beneficial “tools” used by human agents. These systems are also evolving to act as co-assistants in specific domains, potentially influencing human thought and decision-making.</p> 

    <h2 class="sub-heading">Social Consequences of AI Advancement</h2>
    <p class="post-text">these advances in artificial intelligence (AI) will have massive social consequences. Self-driving technology might replace millions of driving jobs over the coming decade. In addition to possible unemployment, the transition will bring new challenges, such as rebuilding infrastructure, protecting vehicle cybersecurity, and adapting laws and regulations.</p> 
    
    <h2 class="sub-heading">Human-Level AI: Fiction or Reality?</h2>
    <p class="post-text">The idea of AI surpassing human intelligence is not new in our society. Before, it was often perceived as something out of a sci-fi movie—a concept that is touched by futuristic fantasies. However, this is a question that is being seriously debated by researchers in artificial intelligence today. Do these experts dismiss the notion as pure fiction, or is it considered a real possibility? The debate is not confined to academic circles; it has profound implications for how the future of technology and society is shaped.</p> 
    
    <h2 class="sub-heading">Defining Artificial General Intelligence</h2>
    <p class="post-text">Furthermore, what we are talking about is a human-level AI, also referred to as Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), defined as a machine or system that is capable of performing any task that humans are able to accomplish. Unlike today's specialized AI—which is designed for tasks like playing chess, recognizing faces, or driving cars—AGI is envisioned as a system that can adapt, learn, and apply its knowledge across various domains. Norvig and Russell, in their renowned AI textbook, describe it as a system that is "able to learn to do anything a human can do."</p> 
    <p class="post-text">Also, such an AI is imagined as one that could not only follow instructions but also determine the best actions that are necessary to achieve its goals and execute them effectively. For instance, it could act as a doctor diagnosing diseases, a translator bridging language gaps, an illustrator creating art, a teacher explaining complex ideas, a therapist offering emotional support, a driver navigating roads, or even an investor making strategic decisions. The potential applications are considered endless, and the implications are seen as staggering.</p> 

    <h2 class="sub-heading">Ethical Considerations and Progress Uncertainty</h2>
    <p class="post-text">On the other hand, the prospect of creating human-level AI raises questions that extend beyond technology. Ethical frameworks must be developed to guide its progress.</p> 
    <p class="post-text">Moreover, experts were asked when they believe there is a 50% chance that human-level AI exists. Human-level AI was defined as unaided machines being able to accomplish every task better and more cheaply than human workers. The fact that there are such large differences in answers makes it clear that experts do not agree on how long it will take until such a system might be developed. A few believe that this level of technology will never be developed. Some think that it's possible, but it will take a long time. And many believe that it will be developed within the next few decades.</p> 

    <h2 class="sub-heading">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="post-text">With that, the huge majority thinks that in the coming decades, there is an even chance that we will see AI technology which will have a huge impact on our world. While some have long timelines, many think it is possible that we have very little time before these technologies arrive. Across the experts, more than half think that there is a 50% chance that a human-level AI would be developed before some point in the 2060s, a time well within the lifetime of today's young people.</p>
